# fetchApiCardGen
- This project was a short one to practice using fetch, async and APIs.
- The emphasis was to create a functional site, aesthetic was not my focus (as evident :p)
- This project took under an hour start to finish.

# Preview
- The ID card created fetches an API, and access fullName, registeryDate, and UUID number.
